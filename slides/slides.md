# How it works:

<v-clicks>

- Alice intelligently identifies platform with similar data domains
- then mixes together their datasets to build up bigger-and-bigger pools of data.
- Finally, we use various methods to train various models on the **mega** dataset
- to produce various "experts" within each domain and sub-domain.

## Alice ensures no priveledged information is leaked across platform borders
- using data anonymization
- advanced transfer-learning methods
- cross-platform user anonymization
- \+ opt-out for regulated industries

# Finally, 2 important questions:
- ## Why would a company use Alice? 
- ## Why share their data with competitors?

<br/>

# Basically:
<v-clicks>

- kindness ðŸ˜‚
- improves their own customer experience
- allows them to focus on their business instead of working on backend systems
